# WordCloud

The repository contains the files:

`ash_word_cloud.R` is an R script which analyses the data and produces the word cloud as an R plot.

`wordcloud_data.js` is the data in Javascript format (a pair of lists)

`wordlcloud_script.js` contains the drawing and interactivity code

`wordcloud.html` is the html code (just a canvas)

The files are put together in `wordcloud2.html` which is currently in `rtrvale.github.io/pages`
